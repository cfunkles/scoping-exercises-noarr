			Exercise 2
			How many different variables named "a" are created here?


				3 variables are created. All called a.


			Can you give each of them a new name while preserving the
			functionality of this code?


				Yes. the variables that are functions only store the value of the function, the naming of the functions doesn't affect the work the function does.
